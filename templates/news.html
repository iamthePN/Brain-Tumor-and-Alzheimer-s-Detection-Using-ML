                    <p>Some months ago Brain Tumor Network was contacted by Rally Foundation who wanted to feature our
                        organization in a featured blog post after hearing about the wonderful Navigation support one of
                        their families received from our team. Read the full blog post on <a
                            href="https://rallyfoundation.org/brain-tumor-network/" target="_blank"
                            rel="noreferrer noopener">RallyFoundation.org</a>:</p>

                    <hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity">
                    <p>Rally Mom Tiffany shared with Rally Foundation the outstanding support their family has been
                        receiving from the Brain Tumor Network (BTN) for her son and Rally Kid, Logan: “<strong>BTN has
                            been a wonderful resource for our family. They are responsive, knowledgeable and
                            compassionate.</strong>”</p>

                    <p>BTN is the largest brain tumor patient support organization of its kind in the U.S. Since 2014,
                        BTN has provided free navigation services to almost 2,000 patients. BTN’s pediatric brain tumor
                        navigation program provides age-appropriate services for families with children under the age of
                        18 whose primary diagnosis is a brain tumor. BTN partners with care teams to meet each
                        individual patient’s goal of care.</p>

                    <p><strong>How BTN Helps</strong><br>Led by Pediatric Neuro-Oncology Nurse Navigators, BTN’s
                        pediatric services include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Diagnosis and treatment options education</li>

                        <li>Treatment center identification</li>

                        <li>Facilitation of second opinions with pediatric brain tumor specialists</li>

                        <li>Personalized, nationwide clinical trial identification and assistance with enrollment</li>

                        <li>Resources for family support</li>

                        <li>Medical records collection and management</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>The Nuts and Bolts<br></strong>Manager of Patient Navigation Kendra, shared, “People
                        often reach out during one of the most stressful times of their lives, right after a diagnosis,
                        and we are here to offer personalized ongoing support.”</p>

                    <p>“After calling BTN or completing the Get Support Form on our website, the BTN team will review
                        and assess all needs and assign a navigator. The patients and their families will hear back from
                        a BTN team member within 24 hours. Being able to connect with a person is invaluable. We know
                        that hearing a person’s voice, having a human connection, is vital and provides comfort.”</p>

                    <p>“Most importantly, we want you to know that we’re here. We help families take this journey step
                        by step, from start to finish. Our team is deeply knowledgeable about brain tumors and can be a
                        guiding force. We understand that sometimes families need a lot of help right in the beginning
                        to get through choppy waters, while others count on our expertise through different stages. We
                        even have a translation service on call to help people for whom English is a second language.
                        BTN can offer bereavement support and can help identify peer and mentor support as well.”</p>

                    <p>Notes Kendra: “We are very fortunate to be able to make an impact without any cost to the patient
                        or his or her family. Our services are provided at no cost to patients, caregivers and
                        healthcare professionals. Additionally, BTN does not receive funding from medical institutions
                        or pharmaceutical companies and does not receive reimbursement or insurance coverage for
                        services, resulting in the ability to provide completely unbiased services.”</p>
